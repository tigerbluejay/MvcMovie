# MvcMovie

MvcMovie is a simple ASP.NET Core MVC web application built to demonstrate the fundamentals of the Model-View-Controller pattern using .NET Core. Originally created as part of a Microsoft tutorial, this project guides developers through core concepts such as scaffolding, data access with Entity Framework Core, and building interactive forms and views. It provides a complete end-to-end example of building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web app backed by a database.

The application models a movie catalog system, allowing users to browse, search, and manage a list of movies. It uses a local SQL Server database and incorporates Entity Framework Core for data persistence. The project is an excellent learning resource for developers new to ASP.NET Core MVC or those looking to reinforce their understanding of how routing, dependency injection, and EF Core integrate into a modern web application.
